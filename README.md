# Project Topic: RnDGrants Management Portal
• The project aims to develop a web-based platform for managing and tracking research and development grants.

• The current system relies on manually updating Excel spreadsheets stored on local office computers, which becomes increasingly challenging as the number of projects and files grows.

• The lack of a centralized system also makes it hard for faculty members and academic office members to access the latest information on specific grants, and generating reports is a time-consuming and complex process.

• The new system will streamline grant management by providing a user-friendly interface for tracking and reporting grant information in real time.
